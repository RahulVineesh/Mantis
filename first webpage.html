  <h2> Mantis ( An Insect)</h2>
<hr>
  <p><b>Mantises</b> are an order (<b><i>Mantodea</b></i>) of insects that contains over <u>2,400 species</u> in about 460 genera in 33 families. The largest family is the Mantidae ("mantids"). Mantises are distributed worldwide in temperate and tropical habitats.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>The closest relatives of mantises are termites and cockroaches (<b><i>Blattodea</b></i>), which are all within the superorder Dictyoptera. Mantises are sometimes confused with stick insects (<b><i>Phasmatodea</b></i>), other elongated insects such as grasshoppers (Orthoptera), or other more distantly related insects with raptorial forelegs such as mantisflies (<i><u>Mantispidae</i></u>).</p>
